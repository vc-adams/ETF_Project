Project: Pairing up insurance rates with weather data for each zip code
The idea of this project is to create a flask app to serve up to a client a bevy of data (in this case Auto insurance rates and weather data) for any zip code or city the client requests. To execute this project, we break it down into several phases.

Extract: We need to extract all the data we intend to serve up to the client. In this case, Auto insurance rates â€“ we intend to scrape insurance rates from various zip codes across the country from here. We will then pull weather data for same zip codes using api calls from here. 
Data sources:
Auto Insurance data:
https://www.autoinsurance.org/quoting-auto-insurance-rates-by-zip-code/
Weather data:
http://api.openweathermap.org/api

Transform: We will clean the data from each source and then merge the data from each source and create a flask app that allows the user to extract auto insurance data as well as weather data for any state, city or zip code they chose.

Load: We intend to load said data into a postgres database and then join the data tables to get the information for our flask server. 

We will then create a flask app to call the data when a client's requests information for a zip code or city.
